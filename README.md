# Isaac Sim Tutorial

This repository provides comprehensive tutorials on Isaac Sim, designed for both beginners and experienced users interested in robot simulation.

## Overview

Our tutorials are organized into two main sections:

### 1. Introduction to Isaac Sim

This course is intended for those with no prior experience in robot simulation. The primary goal is to familiarize users with Isaac Sim and foundational simulation concepts.

### Requirements

Isaac Sim requires substantial computing resources. Before installation, ensure your hardware meets the [official Nvidia Isaac Sim hardware requirements](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/requirements.html).

If your hardware does not meet these requirements, we recommend using AWS EC2 as an alternative.

### AWS EC2 Setup Options

There are three AWS EC2 payment options suitable for Isaac Sim:

| Payment Option | Keywords                                           |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| On-Demand      | Pay-as-you-go, no discount                         |
| Reserved       | 1 or 3-year term, up to 75% discount               |
| Spot           | Spare capacity, up to 90% discount, possible interruptions |
